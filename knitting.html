  <h3><b>NOTE:</b> should try to use up yarn I already have</h3>
  <p>Since this is a hobby I need to get back into, its probably better to not pick something too hard.
  It's also a good idea to knit an piece that <i>inspires</i> me.  Though that may be difficult seeing I'm trying to use the yarn I have.
